#Dynamic typing

# No need to to declare the variable like other language in C ex: int a =5 , Python is Dynamically typed language

# Dyanamic typed: ex: name='kode' print(name).... but the variable as to be declared in correct format.

#name=1234kart
#print(name)

#The above line invalid decimal literal error


#Dynamic binding
# for example in the same program i can assign a value multiple times like name='karthik, name ='kode' but
# in other language it is not possible. its called static binding

# diff types to print or assign values to the variable. 

# a=b=c=6
# a=5;b=6;c=7
# a,b,c = 5,6,7


# a,b,c = 5,6,7
# print(a,b,c)


#Keywords and Identifiers

# to check keywords in python 

# import keyword
# print(keyword.kwlist)

# 33 keywords

# keywords cant be used as variable name

#identifiers
